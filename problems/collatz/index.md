# The Collatz Problem
The Collatz Problem states that for any number $n$, if $n$ is **odd**, $n_{\sf{final}}=3n+1$ but if $n$ is even, $n_{\sf{final}}=\dfrac{n}{2}$. The Collatz Conjecture states 
that after enough iterations, $n = 1$.

## Implementation Details
You will write a program that will run the Collatz Problem and print out the result. Your program will stop once it gets to 1.
